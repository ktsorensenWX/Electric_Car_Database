# Electric Car EDA

## Dataset
Collected data was from Kaggle, of which contained information on roughly 100 different EV's currently being sold or in concept with their information being modeled. Several car companies make more than one type of vehicle, thus there are not 100 different companies. Some companies are excluded from the data, i.e. Rivian, General Motors, Toyota, etc., because this dataset was created prior to the announcements/data given regarding the vehicles in their fleet.

## Goal
As mentioned before, EV's are considered the way of the future and just like combustion engine datasets, it's important to see what car/company is the most reasonable and practical for its needs. My data will be transformed into non-metric units, then plotted, graphed, and forecasted to get an idea of how things will change. Bringing all the information together, the end results produces a basic model with the purpose of informing the viewer on current electric car capabilities regarding range, speed, seating size, and price. I plan on having a thorough description regarding each vehicle that is chosen at the end of the project. Eventually, the dataset will be merged with the most common combustion vehicles to see how much better (or worse) EV's are. Are they really a good replacement, and how do their pollution levels change without an engine?   

## Methods and Libraries
KAGGLE datasets are neat and clean, allowing for the use of several powerful python libraries and tools in EDA:
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* NumPy
* Seaborn

## Personal Purpose
Combustion vehicles have been around for well over 100 years and have always been considered as polluters due to the amount of CO2 they release in chemical reaction. Electric vehicles also have been around for a long period of time, with some reports stating as far back as 1839. As an atmospheric science major, we understand that the earth is very sensitive to chemical changes. Gasoline and diesel powered machinery produce large amounts of CO2, impacting the amount of radiation that is released from the surface. Electric vehicles provide a way to limit individual release, only leaving the creation of the energy the pollutant. I believe electrical machinery is the way of the future, especially in transportation. This dataset provides an understanding of the options available today and what can be used as a bar for future versions.
